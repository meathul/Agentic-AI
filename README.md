# Agent AI Study Repo

Welcome to the **Agent AI Study Repo** — your launchpad for mastering AI agents that think, calculate, and scrape like pros.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Calculator Tool:** A nifty mini-math whiz to crunch numbers on command. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division — you name it.
- **Web Scraper Tool:** Scrapes website content with precision, limited by the number of lines you need. Because sometimes, less is more.
- **Agent Setup:** Seamlessly combines tools with language models to create smart chains that can do multi-step reasoning.
- **Examples & Prompts:** Ready-to-run code snippets to get you experimenting in minutes.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

Forget black-box AI. Here, you see the guts and gears. Learn how to build agents that can:

- Do arithmetic logic
- Parse and fetch real web data
- Chain multiple tools for complex tasks
- Debug and iterate with transparent feedback

Whether you're a student, developer, or just AI-curious — this repo is your playground to experiment and learn.

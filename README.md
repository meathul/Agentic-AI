Agent AI Study Repo

Welcome to the Agent AI Study Repo — your launchpad for mastering AI agents that think, calculate, and scrape like pros.
🚀 What’s Inside?
Calculator Tool: A nifty mini-math whiz to crunch numbers on command. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division — you name it.
Web Scraper Tool: Scrapes website content with precision, limited by the number of lines you need. Because sometimes, less is more.
Agent Setup: Seamlessly combines tools with language models to create smart chains that can do multi-step reasoning.
Examples & Prompts: Ready-to-run code snippets to get you experimenting in minutes.
💡 Why This Repo?
Forget black-box AI. Here, you see the guts and gears. Learn how to build agents that can:
Do arithmetic logic
Parse and fetch real web data
Chain multiple tools for complex tasks
Debug and iterate with transparent feedback
Whether you're a student, developer, or just AI-curious — this repo is your playground to experiment and learn.
